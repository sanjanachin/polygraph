## **Contributions of Team Members**

#### **Past Week Goals**

Aditya: Build prototype of user history feature, write user and developer documentation

Ayan: Finish up firebase auth integration by 2/22 to meet the timeline goals. Start working on how user “keys” will be passed from firestore to backend to correctly associate user history into in our DB. 

Connor: Add fine-tuning to both prompt and model learning. Connect user history endpoint to the frontend. Figure out how to best store and then track a user throughout the website. Make decision on how to host backend site for final release.

Danny: Ensure backend/database can connect smoothly, and refactor/write new methods as needed. Write new tests for any additions. Ensure Firebase user authentication and database user id are managed properly and can interact. Write user and developer documentation, focusing specifically on anything pertaining to the database.

Sanjana: Work on user and development documentation. Specifically for the user documentation, how to run and use the software, and how to report a bug. Specifically for the developer documentation, the directory structure and how to build the software and add new tests to it. 

#### **Current Week Contributions**

Aditya: Finished prototype of polygraph homepage (implemented user history, added real word list for profanity filter, updated api modules), wrote user and developer documentation for frontend

Ayan: I worked on finishing the integration for firebase UI into the project. Tested both sign up with email and google as well as a sign out functionality. 

Connor: Discussed user tracking, kept hosting local for release (updated guide). Pushed and updated bug journal guides and synced frontend/backend repository documentation.

Danny: Wrote new methods for deleting history in the database as well as accompanying tests. Helped with developer documentation.

Sanjana: Worked on user and development documentation for polygraph backend. Added information to the documentation about testing and how to add new tests, how to report bugs, directory structure, and how to build and run the software. Brainstormed ideas for documenting known bugs and decided on and implemented a bug tracker in Google Drive.  


#### **Next Week Planned Contributions**

Aditya: Integrate user history prototype with backend, integrate firebase with other functional parts of project, peer review

Ayan: Currently the auth key is exposed so I need to work with Sanjana to make that secure. Peer review another project. 

Connor: Finish up model fine-tuning and implement user history carry-over from this week. Host backend through a conda-based prebuilt system. Peer review another team project.

Danny: Work on user history, make sure firebase works properly with the database, peer review another team’s project.

Sanjana: Work on user history, peer review another team’s project.
